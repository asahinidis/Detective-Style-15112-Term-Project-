PROJECT DESCRIPTION------------------------------------------------

Detective Style is the name of my project.
 The idea is that you have a number starting at 100
 in the center of the screen and there will be randomly
 generated pieces of code (some with bad style and
 the rest with good style) that will affect the number
 if they reach the center. There will be 20 waves
 during the game. Each wave gets progressively
 more difficult as more and more strings of code
 will appear. Because of this, the game allows
 a 10 second intermission between each wave
 where you are allowed to upgrade / buy boosts
 to help you during the waves. In order to buy
 something, you must place bad style in the
 Prison of Debugging, granting you 1 Grace Day
 (the currency used to buy boosts and upgrades).
